        Unlike most ancient volcanic fissures, Crack-in-the-Ground exists
        today nearly the same as it did thousands of years ago because
        the arid region around it prevented much filling from occurring.
        It reaches over 2 miles long and up to 70 feet deep, with a trail
        along the fissure\'s bottom to hike through and cool off.

        The Chateau at the Oregon Caves is located next to the Oregon
        Caves National Monument, which offers tours through one of the few
        marble caves in the Pacific Northwest of national significance.
        The marble of the caves lies in an isolated block within a faulted
        mixture of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. In the caves
        also lies the River Styx, the underground segment of Cave Creek.

        The name "Witches Cauldron" was given by William Gladstone Steel
        in 1885, and it is located on Wizard Island, a volcanic cinder
        cone, which is situated at the west end of Crater Lake. Approximately
        7700 years ago, Mount Mazama erupted violently, leaving behind
        the hole that became Crater Lake. Two hiking trails are available
        on Wizard Island.
